<!-- Stages of Funding
The most appropriate criteria of deciding the stage of startup funding involves the determination of time-scale and ascertainment of risk-perception associated with the product/ service. The stages of funding broadly fall into two categories: (a) Early Stage and (b) Later Stage.
Early Stage Financing: This stage includes-

Pre- Seed Funding/ Ideation 
Seed Funding/ Validation   
Sunrise/ Early Traction, Series-A or First-Round Financing 
Scaling, Series-B, or Second-Round Financing 

1. Pre- Seed Funding/ Ideation
This is the preliminary stage where the entrepreneur is trying to bring his idea to life. It is principally an ‘applied research’ phase where the promoter tries to transform his idea from a pre-commercialisation project case expected to develop into a prototype which may not necessarily result into a business launch. Here, the primary risk is ‘Marketability’, i.e. whether the idea is viable and whether it or another similar idea has been commercialised before or not?
Funding Sources
This stage requires minimal amount of funding and involves fewer complexities and documentation and sources are very limited and informal channels are available to raise funds. Funding sources at this point consist of Self-financing (Bootstrapping), Family & Friends, Grants from pitching events, Awards from Business Plan conception competitions etc. 



2. Seed Funding/ Validation

This stage involves the transformation of business idea research project into a prototype that could be used for product testing and market trials on a selected and limited potential customer base that could further enable commercialisation on a wider scale. At this stage, the entrepreneur has to hire a competent team, conduct thorough market research alongwith field trials and bring mentors onboard. It must also be ensured that technology being used matches the market opportunities.
Funding Sources
Funds raised at this stage are used essentially for meeting marketing and product development related expenditures. The risk perception of investment at this stage is extremely high. Funding sources at this stage consist of Angel Investors, Crowd funding, business incubators and accelerators, Government Loan Schemes, Collateral-free Debt by Government Agencies.

3. Sunrise/ Early Traction, Series-A or First-Round Financing
This is the post market launch stage where commercial manufacturing has actually commenced and the startup’s products are available to the customers. The essence of this stage is that the product/service is being commercialised for the first time. The product may be Greenfield based on a relatively new or high technology and new business in which the entrepreneur has good knowledge and working experience. 
Funding Sources
Funds raised at this stage are used primarily for product development, expanding the customer base (App Downloads in case of Services) improving your brand credibility by launching novel offerings and tapping new markets by expanding geographical footprints. The risk perception at this stage is very high. 
Funding sources at this stage consist of Venture Capital Funds, Venture Debt Funds and Non-Banking Finance Companies (NBFC). Angel Investors may also participate at this stage but tend to have a diminished influence.
Partly because of the equity dilution clause and partly due to the unviability of the low amount of equity investment, the involvement of Venture Capital Funds at this stage may generally be relatively low. Therefore, some start-ups may approach for Bank Loans as their product/ service starts to gain traction.

4. Scaling, Series-B, or Second-Round Financing
When a business reaches Series B stage, it becomes evident that the startup is now stable, product is marketed right, and the customers are actually buying the product or service. In the light of new consumers and rapidly increasing revenues, further infusion of funds becomes necessary to enhance marketing strategies & channels and form teams as per the business need and add new employees.
Funding Sources
Funds raised at this stage are used primarily for meeting Working Capital requirements, in paying salaries, hiring more staff, improving the infrastructure and establishing it as a major market player. Funding sources at this stage consist of Venture Capital Funds, Private Equity Firms and Alternative Investment Funds (AIF). Venture Capital Funds provide larger funds at this stage than at other early-stage financing.

Later Stage Financing- This stage of startup funding involves established businesses which require additional financial support but cannot take recourse to public issues of capital. It includes-
(i) Growth, Series-C, or Third-Round Financing, Mezzanine/ Development Capital  
(ii) Expansion, Series-D, or Fourth-Round Financing, Bridge Capital
(iii) Initial Public Offering (IPO)/ Going Public/ Floatation

5. Growth, Series-C, or Third-Round Financing, Mezzanine/ Development Capital

Series C funding is meant for a company which is well on its way to the growth path and often interested in expanding broadly. It may be easier to find investors at this stage, as they trust the startup to succeed. In other words, it is the financing of established businesses which have overcome the extremely high-risk early stage and have recorded profits steadily for a few years. At this stage, the start-up experiences a fast rate of market growth with increasing revenues, and has crossed the Break-Even point.
Funding Sources
The development finance stage has a time-frame of one to three years and falls in the medium risk category. Funds raised at this stage are used primarily for meeting expenditure related to building new products, reaching new markets, acquiring underperforming startups in the same industry, purchase of new equipment/plant, expansion of marketing and distribution facilities, re-finance of existing debt, penetration into new regions and induction of new management.
Funding sources at this stage consist of Venture Capital Funds, Private Equity Firms and Alternative Investment Funds (AIF).

6. Expansion, Series-D, or Fourth-Round Financing, Bridge Capital
If a startup finds a potentially lucrative opportunity or a market segment that has come up surprisingly and was not factored in its earlier business plans or has fallen short of achieving the market goals in the previous stage, it may decide to raise more funds in the Series D round to address such issues. In a way, it represents the last round of financing before a planned exit.
Funding Sources
Funding at this stage ‘bridges’ the financial gap between this phase and the IPO. This financing involves low risk perception and a time-frame of one to three years. Startups use such finance to expand business by way of growth of their own productive asset or by the acquisition of other firms/assets of other firms. Funding sources at this stage consist of Venture Capital Funds, Private Equity Firms and usually in the form of a loan or equity investment to provide financing for a relatively short time period until the issuer can complete a longer term financing such as a public offering or a new investment round. These loans are paid back with proceeds from the IPO.

7. Initial Public Offering (IPO)/ Going Public/ Floatation
An IPO consists of the sale of shares to the public by a Startup for the first time. It happens only when a company has an established customer base and stable revenues. Prior to an IPO, companies are considered to be privately held. An IPO issue means that a company's ownership is transforming from private to public—i.e., ‘going public’. This is also the first time that a company tries to raise funds directly from the public on a public platform such as a stock exchange. 
Only startups with a proven track record of profitability and growth can sell stock to the general public and list on the stock exchange. Funds raised from an IPO are used to pay off debts and fund growth initiatives.
The merits of a public issue are liquidity of investments through listing on stock exchanges, higher price of securities compared to private placement and raise their public profile, image and credibility with public, customers & financial institutions. 
Alternative Investment Fund (AIF)
An Alternative Investment Fund may be in the form of Private Equity Fund, Angel Investor Fund, Social Venture Fund, SME Fund etc. They comprise an important source of financing a Start-up at later stages. Alternative Investment Funds are governed by SEBI Alternative Investment Funds regulation, 2012. 
Alternative Investment Fund (AIF) means any fund established/incorporated in India in the form of a trust/company/limited liability partnership/ body corporate which is (i) a privately pooled investment vehicle and collects funds from Indian/foreign investors for investing in accordance with a defined investment policy for the benefit of its investors, and (ii) not covered under the mutual fund/other regulations of the SEBI to regulate fund management activities. 
The AIFs can seek registration in one of the three categories: I, II or III. 

I. Category I AIF: They are funds which invest in start-up or early stage ventures/social ventures/small and medium enterprises (SMEs)/infrastructure/other sectors or areas which the Government/regulators consider as socially/economically desirable and would include Venture Capital Funds, SME Funds, Social Venture Funds, Infrastructure Funds and such other specified alternative investment funds.
II. Category II AIF: They are funds which do not fall under Category I and III and which do not undertake leverage or borrowing other than to meet day-to-day operational requirements. Funds such as Private Equity Funds/Debt Funds for which no specific incentives or concessions are given by the Government or any other regulator are included in this category.
III. Category III AIF: They are funds which employ diverse or complex trading strategies and may employ leverage including through investment in listed or unlisted derivatives. Funds such as Hedge Funds or Funds which trade with a view to make short-term returns or such other funds which are open-ended and for which no specific incentives or concessions are given by the Government or any other regulator are included in this category.
Government of India Financing Initiatives
I. Fund of Funds for Start-Ups (FFS) 
To provide equity funding support for development and growth of innovation driven enterprises, the government has set aside a corpus fund of INR 10,000 Crores managed by Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI). The fund is in the nature of Fund of Funds, which means that the government participates in the capital of SEBI registered Venture Capital Funds, who invest twice the amount in start-ups. The flow of funds is Government > SIDBI > Venture Capitals > Startups. 
FFS has not only made capital available for start-ups at early stage, seed stage and growth stage but also played a catalytic role in terms of facilitating raising of domestic capital, reducing dependence on foreign capital and encouraging home grown and new venture capital funds. 
FFS does not invest directly in start-ups, but participate in the capital of Alternative Investment Funds registered with SEBI. It contributes to the corpus of AIFs for investing in equity and equity linked instruments of various start-ups at early stage, seed stage and growth stage.
All AIFs registered under SEBI AIF Regulations, 2012 (Category I and II) are eligible under FFS. Collectively, the AIFs supported by FFS have a target corpus of over Rs. 48,000 crores. Among the prominent AIFs of leading start-up investment firms supported under FFS are Chiratae Ventures, India Quotient, Blume Ventures, IvyCap, Waterbridge, Omnivore, Aavishkaar, JM Financial, Fireside Ventures, and more.

II. Start-Up India Seed Fund Scheme (SISFS) 

Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), Ministry of Commerce and Industry is initiating Startup India Seed Fund Scheme (SISFS) with an outlay of INR 945 Crores. The scheme was announced by Hon’ble Prime Minister during Startup India International Summit “Prarambh” on 16th January 2021.
Startup India Seed Fund Scheme (SISFS) aims to provide financial assistance to start-ups for proof of concept, prototype development, product trials, market entry and commercialization. This would enable these start-ups to graduate to a level where they will be able to raise investments from angel investors or venture capitalists or seek loans from commercial banks or financial institutions. The target of the scheme is to disburse the Seed Fund to 3,600 start-ups through 300 incubators across India.


Sources of Funding
1. Self- Financing/ Bootstrapping
Bootstrapping means growing the business with no outside investment. It means relying on your savings and revenue to operate and expand. Most founders resort to bootstrapping, which means utilising their savings as there is no external constraint or dilution of control. This would save the entrepreneur from any debt and wouldn’t cost him his equity either since the entire idea will be facilitated by his own resources.
The promoter has to conduct a thorough inventory of his assets which include savings accounts, equity in real estate, retirement accounts, vehicles, recreational equipment and collections. He may decide to sell some assets for cash or to use them as collateral for a loan. Investments may be used as a resource. 
2. Family and Friends
After self-financing, perhaps the second most popular source for startups before seed-funding stage is composed of family, friends and relatives. This is because many times, the promoters’ own resource may not suffice for the capital that he needs. The primary benefit of this source of investment is that there is an inherent level of trust between the entrepreneurs and the investors. 
People with whom the promoter has close relationships know his reliability and level of competence. The major drawback is that if the family members or friends think that lending money gives them right to ‘meddle’ and if the business fails, the issue of paying the money back can be a problem, putting the entire personal relationship at peril.

3. Grants from Pitching Events, Awards from Business Plan Conception Competitions 
There are a number of organizations or platforms which host business events. A startup can consider being a part of such business challenges or competitions to raise funds where the host institutes or organisations provide prize money, grants, or financial benefits. Even though the amount of money may not be generally large, it is usually enough at the ideation stage.

4. Crowd Funding 
These are platforms where entrepreneurs can raise money from a large group of people. Crowd funding platforms are hosted on online web portals that facilitate and streamline project promotion and the raising of capital. 
Crowd funding portals allow promoters to raise money in the form of donations, whereby donors/ contributors do not enjoy any ownership or participation in the said business. Here, one thing must be kept in mind that most individuals donate to facilitate the development of things they care about, to support the causes they espouse. Its major benefits include- obtaining proof of concept, getting free PR and obtaining feedback from potential customers. 
5. Business Incubators and Accelerators  
An incubator is an organisation that offers assistance to startup entrepreneurs in the form of office space, training, and management and all other required resources under one roof. They provide mentoring, funding and networking opportunities. This can result in seed investment and can build the foundation for a longer business arrangement. 
An accelerator is an institution that provides help to a startup to grow over a three-to four-month period, and is therefore a shorter arrangement than that of an incubator. It is a process of rapid, intense and immersive learning & education aimed at accelerating the growth of a startup. It provides mentorship and capital in return for equity.

6. Non-Banking Finance Companies (NBFC) 
NBFCs generally offer their investments in the form of debt for enabling startups to meet their working capital requirements. This is done after the analysis of early traction of the startup in order to justify its revenues so as to validate its ability to finance the interest payment obligations. Some entrepreneurs might prefer debt over equity as debt funding does not dilute the promoter’s equity stake.

7. Government Loan Schemes
The Govt. of India has launched a few debt schemes to provide collateral-free debt to budding entrepreneurs to assist them in getting low cost capital easily. Primary among these are the Startup India Seed Fund Scheme and SIDBI Fund of Funds. Other major schemes include- SAMRIDH scheme, ASPIRE (A Scheme for Promotion of Innovation, Rural Industries and Entrepreneurship), Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY), Atal Innovation Mission (AIM), Multiplier Grants Scheme (MGS), Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE ), Credit Linked Capital Subsidy for Technology Upgradation (CLCSS), and IREDA-NCEF Refinance Scheme.

8. Angel Investors
Angel investors are High Net Worth individuals who invest in startup businesses, normally in the early stages. They invest their money into high-potential startups in return for equity. Angel investors fill the gap between friends and family, and more formal venture capital funds. 
As per SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds Regulations 2012), an Angel Investor means any person who proposes to invest in an angel fund and satisfies one of the following conditions: 
(a) An individual investor who has 
(1) Tangible assets of at least `2 crores excluding value of his principal residence; and 
(2) (i) Early stage investment experience (i.e. prior experience in investing in start-up/ emerging/early-stage ventures);
(ii) Serial entrepreneur (i.e. a person who has promoted/ co-promoted more than one start-up venture);
(iii) Is a senior management professional with at least 10 years of experience;
b) A body corporate with a net worth of atleast 10 crores; 
(c) An AIF registered under SEBI regulations as VCF.

9.  Venture Capital Funds (VCF)
Once a startup has gained significant market traction, and experienced good growth in revenue, it may approach Venture Capital Funds to raise funds for further scaling. Venture Capital is essentially equity finance in relatively new startups when it is fairly quite early to go public for raising funds. However, it is not always in the form of equity. It can also be in the form of debt. 
As per SEBI (Alternative Investment Fund Regulations 2012), a Venture capital fund means “an alternative investment fund which invests primarily in unlisted securities of start-ups, emerging/early-stage venture capital undertakings mainly involved in new products/services, technology / intellectual property right based activities/a new business model”. It is classified under ‘Category I AIF’.
Venture Capital Undertaking means “a domestic company which is (i) not listed on a recognised stock exchange in India at the time of making investment; and (ii) engaged in the business for providing services, production/manufacture of article/things and does not include the following activities/sectors: (1) non-banking financial companies; (2) gold financing; (3) activities not permitted under industrial policy of Government of India; and (4) any other activity which may be specified by the SEBI in consultation with the Government of India from time to time”.

10. Private Equity Funds (PE)
Private Equity is a form of finance where firms make equity investments in private companies that have not yet gone public i.e. whose shared are not traded on the stock market. In a private equity deal, an investor buys a stake in a private company with the hope of ultimately realising an increase in the value of that stake.
As per SEBI (Alternative Investment Fund Regulations 2012), a Private Equity Fund means an AIF which invests primarily in equity/equity linked instruments (i.e. instruments convertible into equity/preference shares, share warrants, compulsorily/optionally convertible debentures) or partnership interests of investee companies (i.e. companies/SPVs/limited partnership/body corporate in which an AIF makes an investment) according to the stated objectives of the fund. It is classified under ‘Category II AIF’.
