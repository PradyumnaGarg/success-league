    <p>
        Success League Business Solutions was conceptualized in 2022, when three astute industry professionals came together and contemplated on the requirements, significance and rationale for a post pandemic new economic order.
    </p>
    <p>
        Competent Lawyers India, the forerunner of Success League Business Solutions had been in the business for well over a decade and had started to render legal services to industry leaders in their respective segments including Banking, Insurance, FMCG & Financial Services. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The firm enjoyed great reputation specifically in the dominions of Corporate Law, Intellectual Property, Real Estate, Securitization, Arbitration & Reconciliation and Corporate Restructuring. Though officiating primarily from Delhi NCR, the firm soon developed Pan India Client base ranging from Kolkata to Chennai, Ahmedabad to Chandigarh and Mumbai to Raipur (CG).
    </p>
    <p>
        By 2019, Competent Lawyers India had 3 major Transnational Companies as its new clients as a result of providing Insightful & Bespoke services. The entity had by now earned immense goodwill for providing cost-effective, synergistic and cutting edge business solutions. 

    </p>
    <p>
        With a combined aggregate experience spanning well over two decades, the new team now consisted of three key members with Vivek & Rajat called on board in 2022 and accordingly a proposal was approved for adding Corporate Advisory to the existing gamut of services paving the way for the formation of Success League Business Solutions.

    <h2 class="text-xl mt-4 font-bold">Why India?</h2>
    <p>In the midst of global political uncertainties, economic downturn and the widespread pessimism surrounding international trade as a result of global pandemic, India presents itself as a beacon of hope, optimism and confidence to the entire international community in virtually every sphere of life. Being one of the largest recipients of Foreign Direct Investment in the world and the most preferred investment destination as affirmed by multiple credit agencies and financial institutions, India carries upon itself a responsibility to live upto global investor expectations.</p>
    <p>In today's times, the progress of a commercial entity depends not only on how skilled its workforce is, but also on how fast it can acquire the latest information on various factors influencing the business environment and how quickly it can incorporate the same into its policy matters thereby favourably impacting the quality of its business decisions.</p>
    <p>Encouraged by the various government initiatives, a large number of professionals are now preferring entrepreneurship and consequently, India is rapidly becoming a hub for unicorn companies. According to studies by credible industry sources, India is home to the third largest number of technology driven start-ups in the world after the US and the UK.</p>
    <h2 class="text-xl mt-4 font-bold">Vision</h2>
    <p>To emerge as a leading transformational business mentor on the nation’s entrepreneurial landscape facilitating innovation-led development thereby generation of additional value-added services enabling higher operational efficiency and technological competence.</p>


    <h2 class="text-xl mt-4 font-bold">Mission</h2>
    <p>To offer a comprehensive kaleidoscope of legal, financial and corporate services to enable our clients to earn increased customer loyalty, brand recognition and sales accompanied with significant cost-effectiveness, commercial integrity and time-bound excellence.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl mt-4 font-bold">Logo</h2>
    <p>The Logo of Success League Business Solutions aptly represents its motto towards ‘Striving for the Best’ and ‘Steering the Client Enterprises towards achieving their Corporate Objectives’. The Three Stars represent the much valued traits of- ‘Perseverance’, ‘Innovation’ and ‘Competitiveness’, while the Two Palms in a Cupping Pose represent the much cherished virtue of Conserving the interests of the society within the framework of ‘Ethical Norms’ and ‘Sustainability’.</p>
    <h2 class="text-xl mt-4 font-bold">Demographic Advantage</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc list-outside">
        <li>The country is expected to rank amongst the world's top three growth economies and amongst the top three manufacturing destinations by 2030.</li>
        <li>Favourable demographic dividends for the next 2-3 decades. Sustained availability of quality workforce.</li>
        <li>Strong consumerism in the domestic market.</li> 
        <li>Strong technical and engineering capabilities backed by top-notch scientific and technical institutes.</li>
        <li>The cost of manpower is relatively low as compared to other countries.</li> 
    </ul>
    <p> <i class="italic">Thus, India offers the 3 'Ds' for businesses to thrive— Democracy, Demography and Demand.</i> Add to that a tech-savvy and educated population, skilled labour, robust legal and Intellectual Property regime and a strong commitment to calibrated liberalization — India is a destination that global investors and corporates cannot overlook. The Government of India is committed to promote industrialization in the country and improve the investment climate of the country. As a result, the current trend towards an increase in the number of entrepreneurs and new projects presents an opportunity for an increased demand for legal, regulatory, financial, technical and market information and related services that will enable companies to stay ahead of the rest.</p>

    <p>Under the present circumstances, the legal ramifications of the current global pandemic are also expected to be considerable. In view of the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and consequent lockdown announced by the Government, it is quite likely that performances under several contracts might have got delayed, interrupted, or even terminated and cancelled. Parties to such contracts may seek to delay and/or avoid performance of their contractual obligations and/or seek various relief(s) under the ‘force majeure’ clause.</p>
    <p>Such non-performance could either be on account of genuine difficulty arising out of COVID 19 or could also be on account of use of the same as an excuse to relieve themselves from an unfavourable bargain. Further, parties may also cite COVID-19 as a basis for renegotiation of price or other key contractual provisions. It will also be relevant to see as to how the Courts are going to consider COVID-19 as a ‘force majeure’ event in the commercial contracts.</p>
    <p>Success League is keeping a ‘Keen Eye’ on all the major developments in this regard so as to provide best-in-class emergency assistance to its valuable clients.</p>
